  abstract  = {Enterprise Systems Engineering (ESE) is the application of systems engineering principles, concepts, and methods to the planning, design, improvement, and operation of an enterprise. The development of an enterprise poses new challenges for Systems Engineering (SE) to address enterprise architecture, strategic technical planning, enterprise analysis and organizational behavior. In this paper, we first summarize the evolution of technology product development, discuss the concepts of Enterprise Systems (ES), and review recent research works on Enterprise Systems Engineering (ESE) with Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Enterprise Ontology (EO). With the goal of successful integration of technology and human-beings, we then propose an updated ontology of the EA framework, highlight the new trend of Model based Enterprise (MBE), the ES ``Vee'' model, and present challenges of future research on ESE posed by ES requirements, scope, synthesis, model-based design, integration, and verification and validation.},
